## About

While their are a number of similarities, written and spoken language differ in a number of key points. One such difference is in the permanence of the speech. Spoken language only exists as long as it remains in the minds of the listener, but written language leaves an artifact behind as a record of what has been said. 

Throughout history people have attempted to keep their messages private for a number of reasons. These include securing military actions, concealing love letters, or hiding nefarious actions. In order to do so, people have employed various forms of [cryptography](http://LanguageAndTheInternet.github.io/terms/Cryptography.html). As various forms of encoding language have gained popularity, actions have been taken to prevent their use, due to fear that encoding language will lead to criminal actions.

One of the [modal affordances](http://LanguageAndTheInternet.github.io/terms/Modal_Affordance.html) of the internet is that records are left beheind about what is said. Tools such as the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/) allow people to view the history of website and what was written on them as specific points in time.
